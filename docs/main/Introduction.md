> **Hello there!, I am karandeep Singh, Friends call me KD**


## 👋 Introduction

I'm a third year student pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science from VIT, Vellore. I intend to develop excellent development skills to contribute to the tech world in the best of my ability.

```js
const karan = {
    pronouns: "He" | "Him",
    code: ["Javascript", "C", "C"++, "Python", "Java", "php"],
    askMeAbout: ["web dev", "tech", "Competitive programming ", "geo politics"],
    technologies: {
        backEnd: {
            code: ["node", "express", "php"],
        },
        frontEnd: {
            js: ["Vue(#skills to acquire)"],
            css: ["materialize", "tailwind", "bootstrap"],
            framework: ["React"]
        },
        devOps: ["AWS", "Docker🐳(#skills to acquire)", "Heroku"],
        databases: ["mongo", "MySql", "firebase(#skills to acquire)"],
        },
    skills_to_acquire:["Firebase", "Socket.IO", "VIEW.JS", "Typescript", "Next.js"],
    currentFocus: "Problem solving skills and Competitive programming",
    funFact: "There are two ways to write error-free programs; only the third one works"
};
```

## 📚 Education 


**Education is what remains after one has forgotten  everything he learned in school 😂**

- ```js
  const education[0]={
 
   ICSE:  ["Percentage:- 87 form desouza's school",
           "Been active speaker at various events.",
           "Wrote my first code in QBasic 😁",
           // now I laugh why do they even teach QBasic to us😁
           "Got Introduced to java in class 8",
           //java blew my mind and got me into coading
           //I didn't had an internet connection and a PC 
           //I wish I had 😀 to learn Java
           "Java continued till my 12th Grade",
           //I learned basic of java
          ],
 
   ISC:   ["Percentage:- 85.6 form desouza's school",
           "Had a lot of fun","Bcame basket ball captain of my house",
           //took part in debates and hosted our anual day 
           //Being from a small city and Jeo got introduced recently.
           //I didn't had any what IIT's are 😅 Thank god I didn't
           //Had an incredible time there 😁
           //Started preparing for JEE just after I got to know about what it is😁
           "Cleared JEE mains, VIEEE and got into VIT",
          ],
   VIT:   ["Current CGPA:- 8.6",
          //I hope this won't fall further 🤞.
          //If you are a recruiter please remember 
          //Thomas Edison ones said
          //a single sheet of paper can't decide my future😁.
          <!-- My time in vit cant be summarised in short to be included here please 
          find it below if you are interested -->

  }

### 🧬 My life in VIT 

  

## Skills 🤹‍♀️

  All skills are perfected through the process of failure. Embrace loss as a necessary part of improvement.

  VIT provides a great environment for kids like me to indulge ourselves in events organised on campus and find our real passion and explore as many domains as possible.

  I did the same spent my 1st year banging into random events and learning how things work and do they excite me. Through the process I learned that development is my passion, I learnt that I can't sit in front of a book for 2Hr but can spend days coding my next project.

  Crawling through huge documentations of tools, Frameworks and Api's for hours and at the end finding one solution to my problems is what I love. Through this process of building and learning, I got to know about a lot of stuff. I may not be great at some of the stuff as of now but I am a quick learner and can get things done for sure. Development tought me the art of effective documentation.


```js
const skills = {
    code: ["Javascript", "C", "C++", "Python", "Java", "php"],
    technologies: {
        backEnd: {
            code: ["node", "express", "php"],
        },
        frontEnd: {
            js: ["Vue(#skills to acquire)"],
            css: ["materialize", "tailwind", "bootstrap"],
            framework: ["React"]
        },
        devOps: ["AWS", "Docker🐳(#skills to acquire)", "Heroku"],
        databases: ["mongo", "MySql", "firebase(#skills to acquire)"],
        },
    skills_to_acquire:["Firebase", "Socket.IO", "VIEW.JS", "Typescript", "Next.js"],
    currentFocus: "Problem solving skills and Competitive programming",
};
