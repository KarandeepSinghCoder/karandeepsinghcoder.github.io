## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

Travel Buddy helps my fellow VITIANâ€™s to find their colleagues travelling in the train or planning to travel,this helps them to connect to each other and book tickets accordingly so that they could be together in the journey. This site also facilitates Users in sharing cabs to Bangalore and Chennai.

- This increase the scene of security in parents and even students that they are travelling with their colleague.
- During this corona virus it's important to keep social distancing its really impossible to maintain social distancing among a careless crowd those who donâ€™t understand its         importance, thus by this website we VITIANâ€™s could be together and can come back to college safely.
- This website will work on a real-time database as VITIANâ€™s will be free to add their details we will collect the data on an online server cluster and will show their fellows who   are travelling or willing to travel that day in that particular. This will include trains via Katpadi as of now and can be extended accordingly.
