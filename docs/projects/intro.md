I never try copying my projects instead, I come up with new ideas on what can be done. Most of my projects Ideas are based on solving a real-world problem or improving an already existing technology of dev tool. I do feel my projects reflects how I think and how effeciently I can solve a problem.

Write now I am working with **[DocSream](docs/docstream)**, This is an faster altrenative to google docs where a user can host their documents in minimal time skipping the long authentication processe involved in GDocs. **[DocSream](docs/docstream)** is inspired by **[CodeShare](https://codeshare.io/)** and **[Protect Text](http://protectedtext.com/)**

**[Travel Buddy](/docs/travelbuddy)** was my First Major Project which I took to help my college mates find travel companians back home and vice versa, Travel Buddy also includes cab sharing option from vellore to chennai or Bangalore.

*When I see my older codes as in Travel Buddy I laugh and wounder how could I have written such a bad codeüòÅ. This projects shows me my growth as a developer*
